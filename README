MIRROR Spaces SDK for Java
--------------------------

Implementation of the MIRROR Spaces SDK for Java-based MIRROR applications. 

Installation
------------
Add all JAR-files provided with this package to the classpath of the
application.

Usage
-----
The SDK for Java implements the SDK API and provides three handlers:

1. ConnectionHandler:
  A handler to establish and manage the connection to the XMPP server.

2. SpaceHandler:
  This handler provides a set of methods to manage the spaces you can access.
  There are methods for the access, creation, management, and deletion of
  spaces. For space management operations the application has to be online.
  Retrieving space information is also possible in offline mode, as long as the
  information is available in the handler's cache. 

3. DataHandler:
  The data handler provides methods to register for notifications about newly
  published data, and with methods to send and retrieve it. All items published
  and received while being online are stored and therefore also available when
  the handler is offline.

Details about the usage of the handlers are available of the SDK API documentation.

The complete API documentation for the Java SDK is available online:
